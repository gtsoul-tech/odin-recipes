    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Gnocchi will always hit the spot for a quick, delicious meal. Yes, it's great on its own as a main, but it also makes for a winning, hearty sidekick to roasted chicken or rosemary pork chops too!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Obviously roasting a block of feta with bursting tomatoes is going to be amazing. But is it good enough to break TikTok like this one did? Our answer, begrudgingly, is yes. It's geniusâ€”super-easy, but fancy enough for date night.</p>
